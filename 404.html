<h1>Transformer Revenge Of The Fallen</h1>

<marquee style="font-size:20; background-color:red">Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen is a third-person shooter video game based on the 2009 live action film Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen. The PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions were developed by Luxoflux, and ported to Microsoft Windows by Beenox. The PlayStation 2 and Wii versions were developed by Krome Studios, and the PlayStation Portable version was developed by Savage Entertainment. The game was released on June 23, 2009 in the United States. Australia received the game one day later, and Europe on June 26.
The series of games loosely follow the plot of their movie counterpart. The PC, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360 versions feature a split-campaign format, with both an Autobot and Decepticon campaign. The PlayStation 2 and Wii versions combine the Autobot and Decepticon stories into one campaign that alternates between factions. Transformers Revenge of the Fallen: Autobots and Transformers Revenge of the Fallen: Decepticons are the Nintendo DS versions of Revenge of the Fallen, developed by Vicarious Visions. Similar to Transformers Autobots and Transformers Decepticons, the DS version is split into two separate games. Autobots follows the heroes' perspective while Decepticons follows the perspective of the villains.
Revenge of the Fallen received mixed reviews on the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 systems, holding scores of 63.55% and 63.46% at GameRankings and 63 and 61 out of 100 at Metacritic. The PlayStation 2 and Wii scored lower, with 46% and 53% at GameRankings, respectively. The DS iterations fared slightly better, with a critic average of 66.82% for Autobots and 69% for Decepticons at GameRankings.</marquee>
